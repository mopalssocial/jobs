# Rails Challenge

Hi! Thanks for taking a look at the MoPals Ruby-on-Rails Backend Coding challenge. We are looking for intermediate-senior RoR developers to join our Backend team.

Here at MoPals, our web and mobile clients are powered by our JSON API that runs on Rails. This serves up our consumer and business facing websites, consumer and business apps, powers all of our analytics and machine learning, as well as supports our in administration portal. We are looking for Rails developers who are passionate about the backend of things - routing, data migrations, integration with third party software services, and automated testing. We are also looking for applications with a solid understanding of Ruby, able to dig deeper into Rails and get more out of the language.

Responsibilities:
- Take ownership of projects throughout the entire development lifecycle
- Develop core parts of our products in a scalable and reliable way
- Take pride in maintaining a robust, well organized, and throughly tested codebase
- Unafraid to think

Requirements:
- Proficiency in Ruby on Rails
- Experience with Postgresql (or equivalent)
- Comfortable writing thorough and comprehensive Rspec tests
- Solid understanding of API design
- A knack for data modelling and architecture
- Navigation of a development environment using UNIX and Git
- Not afraid to think and take on new challenges

Assets:
- Experience developing JSON APIs
- Familiarity with ElasticSearch, Redis or AWS
- Familiarity with deployment chains and integrations with other software services.

Please complete as many of the challenges as you are able to and submit a pull request with your solutions. You will be contacted after we examine your work.

Best of luck!
